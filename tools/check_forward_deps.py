"""Fail if any result cites a result proved in a later section of the book.

Reads `_build/crossref_labels.json`, which the HTML build writes. Every label
carries the `file` it lives in and a `uses` list of the labels cited inside its
block and its proof.

Every label is placed by its file path -- chapter directory, then the section
number in the file name -- and by nothing else. **Do not mix in the `number`
field.** That field is positional: while a chapter has a gap (its section 07
not yet written, say), the build numbers section 10's results 16.9, while the
file name still says 10. An earlier version of this tool placed numbered
results by `number` and exercises by path; the two disagreed across the gap,
which reported false forward citations and could have hidden a real one.

The tool compares sections only. Labels in the same section are reported as
unordered, not as errors: the third component of `number` counts within a type
(`def-connectives` and `thm-contrapositive-equivalent` are both 0.1.1), so it
cannot order two labels, and ordering inside a section is the job of the
section's referee, who can see the text.

Run after `./build.py html`. Exits 1 if anything cites a later section.
