"""Fail if any proof in the book rests on a result proved in a later section.

Reads `_build/crossref_labels.json`, which the HTML build writes. Every label
carries the `file` it lives in, a `uses` list of the labels cited inside its
block and the blocks that follow it, and `uses_kinds`, which says for each cited
label *which environment* cited it.

That last field is what separates the two things a forward citation can be.

* A citation from a **proof**, a proof idea or a claim is load-bearing: the
  argument as written is not complete until the reader has gone forward and read
  something the book has not yet proved. That is a defect, and this tool fails
  on it.
* A citation from an example, an exercise, a solution, a remark, a warning or a
  statement is a **signpost**: "Chapter 43 does this properly". It costs the
  reader nothing and it is how the book is meant to point at what is coming.
  `authoring/STATUS.md` records that these stay; there are eighty of them, over
  a hundred and twenty chapter pairs, and they are listed with `--signposts`
  rather than treated as errors.

A citation whose kind was not recorded -- an index written before `uses_kinds`
existed -- counts as load-bearing. The reading paths make the opposite choice
and count an unknown kind soft, because there the cost of a wrong guess is a
reader carrying a section they did not need; here it is a gap in a proof, so
this one guesses the other way.

Every label is placed by its file path -- chapter directory, then the section
number in the file name -- and by nothing else. **Do not mix in the `number`
field.** That field is positional: while a chapter has a gap (its section 07
not yet written, say), the build numbers section 10's results 16.9, while the
file name still says 10. An earlier version of this tool placed numbered
results by `number` and exercises by path; the two disagreed across the gap,
which reported false forward citations and could have hidden a real one.

The tool compares sections only. Labels in the same section are reported as
unordered, not as errors: the third component of `number` counts within a type
(`def-connectives` and `thm-contrapositive-equivalent` are both 0.1.1), so it
cannot order two labels, and ordering inside a section is the job of the
section's referee, who can see the text.

Run after `./build.py html`. Exits 1 if a proof cites a later section, or if any
citation names a label that does not exist.

Also run as part of `./build.py check`, through `find_violations` and `report`,
