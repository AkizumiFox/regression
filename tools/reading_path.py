"""Which sections must a reader actually read to reach a given section?

Reads `_build/crossref_labels.json`, which the HTML build writes. Every label
carries the `file` it lives in, a `uses` list of the labels it cites, and
`uses_kinds`, which says for each cited label *which environment* cited it: the
owning result's own type for a citation in its statement, or `proof`, `idea`,
`remark`, `solution`, `check`, ... for a citation in a block that follows it.

That distinction is the whole point of this tool:

* a **hard** edge is a citation from a proof, a proof idea or a claim. Remove
  the cited result and the citing theorem is no longer proved.
* a **soft** edge is a citation from a statement, a remark, a warning, an
  exercise, a solution or a check. Remove the cited result and a sentence needs
  rewording, or an exercise loses its point, but nothing is left unproved.

The one case that is genuinely both is the solution: a solution is the proof of
its exercise, and solutions make half of the book's citations. So the policy is
a parameter, `hard_kinds`, and the book publishes both answers side by side --
a reading path (`HARD_KINDS`) and a path for a reader who also works the
exercises (`EXERCISE_KINDS`) -- rather than choosing for the reader.

One more thing can make an edge soft: the result that made it. A result marked
`::: {#thm-foo .optional}` is one no reader is obliged to read -- an illustration,
or a bridge to another part of the book. Nothing requires it, so nothing it cites
can be required through it, and **every** citation it makes is soft, whatever
block it was written in. Its own section still shows as context on the soft view.
That is only honest while nothing proves anything from an optional result, which
`tools/check_optional.py` enforces and `./build.py check` fails on.

The graph is built **section by section**, not chapter by chapter (chapter-level
closures are roughly twice the size) and not from `scan.json`'s per-page `refs`,
which is what the dependency-graph page uses today: `refs` counts every citation
on a page, including the chapter introduction and the "What you need" prose,
which makes almost everything depend on almost everything.

A path is *closed* when every hard dependency of every section in it is itself
in the path. An unclosed path is a reader hitting a gap, and is the one bug this
tool exists to prevent; `is_closed` checks it and `--verify` reports it.

A target is written `<chapter directory>/<section number>`, the way the file
names it: `ch12-psd-and-svd/08`, or `ch12-psd-and-svd/index` for a chapter's
index page. A profile is a named set of targets kept in `config/config.json`,
which is also what the generated reading-path pages are built from. Run
`./build.py html` first.
