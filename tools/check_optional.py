"""Fail if any proof in the book rests on a result marked optional.

A result written `::: {#thm-foo .optional}` carries a promise, printed on the page
in both editions: *nothing later depends on this*. A reader who skips it loses an
illustration and nothing else, and `tools/reading_path.py` takes the promise at its
word -- an optional result's citations are never prerequisites, so it drags no
section onto anybody's reading path.

The promise is only true while nobody proves anything from it. One proof citing an
optional result and the claim on the page is a lie, the reading paths are short by
however many sections that proof needed, and a reader who skipped the result walks
into a gap. So it is checked here, the way `tools/check_forward_deps.py` checks that
no proof cites a later section: read `_build/crossref_labels.json`, find every hard
citation of an optional result, print the citing sites and exit 1.

*Hard* means the same thing it means to the reading paths, and then some: a proof, a
proof idea, a claim -- and a solution, which is the proof of its exercise. A reading
path may leave the exercises out; an optional result may not be what an exercise is
solved with, because the solution is printed in the book and would be unsupported for
the reader who skipped the result. Everything else -- a remark, a statement, a
warning, a "compare" in prose -- is fine, and is how an optional result is meant to be
referred to.

Run after `./build.py html`. Also run as part of `./build.py check`.
