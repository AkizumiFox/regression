"""Lint the book's sources for two shapes that silently break a display.

Pandoc only parses \\[ ... \\] as display math when the block is one paragraph.
Two things end the paragraph early, and then the display is emitted as literal
text: stray "[" and "]" on the web page, and LaTeX errors in the PDF. MathJax
still renders the loose \\begin{aligned} it finds, so the web page looks
almost right, which is how 21 + 20 displays across Chapters 0-16 went unnoticed.

1. A blank line inside the display.
2. A line inside the display that begins like a list item ("+ ", "- ", "1. ",
   "(a) " ...). Inside a paragraph that is itself a list item, such as a
   solution beginning "(a)", Markdown starts a nested list there.

A third shape breaks only the PDF, and breaks it silently: a character outside
ASCII inside a math span. pdflatex drops an unmapped one with no error at all,
so the PDF gate passes and the sentence loses a symbol. Chapter 19 wrote the
degree sign as a raw glyph, and the printed book read "the angle is less than
13". Unicode in ordinary prose is fine; the preamble maps what the book uses.
